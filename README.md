##Lessons Learned
I learned how to use the requestmapping, while file.do and file.jsp have different roles and I learned how to use them correctly. Otherwise, i can not direct the desired page without the jsp files.Also, some logic ideas exist between queries, i
need figure it out otherwise, it will perform the logical errors. And I find though I have the toString method in film classes, seems like the print out sentence are fixed by the toString, however, you can do something in the result.jsp to make the sentence looks good. At last, when I am not quite sure whether there exist the code errors in the DAOImpl method or not. I alwasys can use the Test package to do the running test, and sometimes, you only need to check whether some existing data is null or not, that is enough for you to make sure whether there exist the code problems.
